				<h3>A minimalist money tracker.</h3>
				<p>I built this app when I started tracking my daily expenses down to the penny. I was using a pocket notepad and a pen but found it to be a hassle to parse through it all at the end of the week &amp; month for adding things up. I've used MS Money, Quicken and Mint before, all with great failure. Automatic tracking doesn't work for me because I just kinda forget about it and my money is magic again. I built this app for myself and it's worked phenomenally. I have a lot more money on hand than I used to, even though I make the same amount. I know the other guys have manual tracking but they also have a lot of bells and whistles and too much confusion to make it a simple, useful process for me to monitor and save my money.</p>

				<h2>CardsInk</h2>
				<h3>Crowd-sourced greetings.</h3>
				<p>I built CardsInk.com for Dan Dyer in New York after he found my website and asked me to make his idea into a web app. He wanted a simple, elegant site that could be run by the customers. Some would upload and submit designs, others would vote and shop. Yep, kinda like Threadless for cards. I built the entire site in Ruby on Rails, using the ActiveMerchant eCommerce gem to handle the transactions. I used Blueprint CSS to achieve a solid, consistent layout with minimal effort. The code is test/behavior-driven and is maintainable.</p>
