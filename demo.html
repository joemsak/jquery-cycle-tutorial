				<h2>Arts &amp; Business Council of Chicago</h2>
				<h3>Helping Arts &amp; Businesses Connect</h3>
				<p>The Arts &amp; Business Council of Chicago has been serving Chicago for 25 years to strengthen the arts community through its partnerships, programs, resources, and services. We're pleased to announce the launch of a bold, redesigned website that conveys the energy and spirit of the organization. A bright, new look with strong imagery and type styles helps extend the existing brand. Resources for business volunteers and non-profits are easy to find and registrations for workshops and events are simple to use and update. A news blog keeps visitors up-to-date about trends and issues affecting the community.</p>
